2.What are the branches in github?
ans.Branching is a way to work on different version of repository at one time.
By default your repository has one branch named master which is considered to be the definitive branch. 
We use branches to experiment and make edits before committing them to master.
When you create a branch off the master branch, youâ€™re making a copy, or snapshot, of master as it was at that point in time. 
If someone else made changes to the master branch while you were working on your branch, you could pull in those updates.

3.What is PR?
ans.A pull request is submitted when you've worked on some code from a particular branch and wantto inform the others of the changes you've made.
People can be assigned to review and subsequently approve the request before your changes can be incorporated with the branch.

4.Can we delete the master branch. If no why?
ans.Yes we can delete the master branch, but only after creating a new branch and set that branch as the default one.
